          Tired of going to laundromats and seeing all the machines occupied? We use GPS to locate the closest
          laundromat to
          you.
          By using our service we caln help you with the inconvience of waiting in a packed laundromat. Our service
          tells
          you if
          machines are available or in use, on top of that you can make reservations. This removes the human factor of
          interacting
          with people asking if they are done using a machine. Our simple web application meets the needs of any
          community
          by providing
          an easily accepsible system to locate, check availability, reserve, and pay for a machine.
