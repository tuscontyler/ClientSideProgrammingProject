        <h1>Problem Description</h1>
        <p>
            It can be difficult to find a laundromat that has enough washers and dryers available for use and even more difficult to manage that laundry from a distance.
             We can use GPS to find the nearest laundromat but can’t tell whether it has machines available and nor can you reserve them.
              Presently, there is no way for individuals of a community who use laundromats to schedule, manage, or pay for a machine without having to interact with anyone. 
             A simple web application could meet the needs of an entire community by providing them with an array of tools needed to locate, check availability, schedule, check time, and pay for their services. 
             Individuals who use this application won’t have to worry about leaving the house without a laundry card or wallet, getting to the laundromat just to see it’s packed and there’s no machines, and having someone beat you to the last machine because they got the parking spot closer to the entrance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There exist laundromat software solutions, like Cents, that allows you to control machines for efficiency, organize pickup and delivery, and even POS options. 
                The only issue is that this software, like many available today, are exclusive to businesses.
                 There exists consumer solutions but their largely proprietary to apartment complexes and universities or, like Automatic Laundry, still require you to hang on to your laundry card and use a kiosk to reload it.
                 There should be a simpler, more all-in-one, way to manage laundry from a distance and avoid the pitfalls of in-person washing and easily forgettable cards.

        <h1>Application Description</h1>
        <p>
            Based on the above problem description above, we decided to base our semester project around idea of a laundromat system. 
            First off, the users of our system/web application would be individuals who are seeking to use a laundromats service, with the intention of wanting to know locational data about the laundromat ahead of time.
             The users could range from anyone from college students to families who use laundromats for their clothes, there is no one target audience for this web application.
              The data that the users would be interacting with can be broken down into a few different types of data.
               The first being locational data presented to them in a way like how Google presents their search results on maps.
                We would want this to be nicely formatted in a way that is appealing to the user’s eye but also in way that is simple to understand, with the additional way of being able to search and filter out desired locations.
                 The second type of data would be the User Interface of each location’s machines that are on the physical site this would show the user(s) which machines are available/occupied/broken, in addition to the time left on current loads.
                  This could be further expanded into the user being able to reserve the machine they would like to use and preset load settings so that when they arrive on site, all they must do is out their items in and hit “Start”.
                   Lastly the third way the user(s) will be interacting with the data would be a form submission, this form would be used to request more locations being added to the laundromat system for further use.

            <h2> Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Location Filtering: The user will be able to sort and filter out locations within the systemn via various parameters, such as name and zipcode </li>
                <li>Digitial Status of machines: Users wiil be able to see which machines are free to use, in use at the moment. In addition to being able to remotely reserve a machine and preset its load settings.</li>
                <li>User Requests of more locations: Users would be able to submit a form to request the addtion of a Laundromat to the system, given they provide address information to the location</li>
